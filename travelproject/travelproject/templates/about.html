    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h2>
        Pack your bags. We’re going on vacation!<br><br>

        That’s exactly what an effective travel website should make you feel. It should activate the travel bug with vibrant imagery and vivid copy.<br><br>

        And while photos can do a lot of the work in inspiring visitors, a travel site can’t accomplish its purpose without great web design.<br><br>

        Web design plays a major role in visitors’ first impressions of a business. In fact, in one study, when participants were asked why they distrusted a website, 94% of the comments were about design.<br><br>

        For a travel site, this means that design can be the determining factor in whether a visitor trusts recommendations and information.<br><br>

        And considering the significant investments that go into planning a trip, trust is essential.<br><br>

        It can make or break a traveler’s decision to take a certain tour, stay at a certain hotel, or even visit a city or country altogether.<br><br>

        Plus, beyond serving as a trustworthy source of inspiration, a travel site also needs to give would-be travelers all the information they need to arrange their travel plans.<br><br>

        Once a visitor is convinced that they need to see the sights in the photos for themselves, it should be easy for them to plan their trip.<br><br>

        This means that the site needs to have straightforward travel information, helpful logistical details, and tips that will help visitors simplify the travel process.<br><br>

        Not all travel sites tick all of these boxes, but the ones that do stand out from all the rest.<br><br>

        High-quality photography<br>
        A brief summary of the area, with highlights of important places<br>
        Hotel recommendations with web links to hotel and booking sites<br>
        Information about recreation and outdoor activities<br>
        Guides to arts and culture, including museums, theaters, and other attractions<br>
        Packing tips<br>
        Maps and guides<br>
        Public transport information<br>
        Airport information<br>
        Relevant tips on language and local dialect<br><br>

        Of course, your site likely won’t need to include all of the elements on this list. Tailor it to your needs.<br><br>

        And there’s tons of example travel sites that we can use for inspiration. <a href="#">Let’s get started.</a>
